- Hey there, I'm Mary Stormborn, but you can call me Maryam Sadoughi. I'm a 20-year-old computer engineering student, and my journey in the world of technology is just beginning. However, my love for all things tech didn't start here; it's been with me since birth. I've always been fascinated by both software and hardware.
As I grew up, I delved into learning several programming languages. However, as a multi-passionate individual, finding my path wasn't easy. Despite the challenges I've faced, here I am, pouring my heart into learning, teaching, and working.
- I have a keen interest in statistics, data science, and machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).
-  Currently, I'm focused on mastering data analysis and optimizing models. Additionally, I'm venturing into the field of web development, with a particular emphasis on back-end development, and I'm learning ASP.NET.
-  I'm actively seeking collaboration opportunities in the tech world. I'm passionate about learning and can contribute effectively in my areas of expertise, especially in data analysis.
-  here's my email if you needed to reach me, maryamsadoughi.sdg@gmail.com
